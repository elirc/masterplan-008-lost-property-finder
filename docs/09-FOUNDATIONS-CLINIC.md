# M008: foundations clinic

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

The register stores calendar days, not moments on a clock. Once dates have a valid fixed-width calendar representation, strict string comparison can answer whether one day precedes another. The loop must validate records even when they would not match. A fresh result protects caller-owned data at the documented flat-object boundary.

## Start from one visible behavior

Read this contract slowly: Each flat item has a unique string id, a nonblank label and a real YYYY-MM-DD foundOn date. The cutoff is exclusive. Results preserve source order, return new shallow item objects and never update the input array.

Underline the promised result, circle the input boundary and mark the stated limitation. A junior developer often starts by naming a framework or file. Start instead with an observation that a user could confirm or reject. File names become useful after you know which responsibility you are looking for.

## Clinic 1: Date-only value

A calendar day without a time or timezone.

**Small experiment:** Explain why a timestamp is unnecessary for this contract.

Find the part of `findBefore and isDateOnly` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

### Predict before inspecting

Write one ordinary example and one example that makes the distinction matter. Give an expected result for each. The second example should separate two plausible implementations; simply changing a name or color may leave both candidates behaving identically. Explain why your chosen variation is informative.

### Build a tiny explanation

Explain **date-only value** in three sentences: what problem it names, where you can see it in this repository, and what would go wrong if you ignored it. Avoid replacing the explanation with a slogan such as “best practice.” A concrete input, property or event should appear in at least one sentence.

### Repeat with less support

Close this paragraph, revisit the source and reconstruct the explanation without copying. Then deliberately change one assumption and predict which part of the explanation must change. Record the first point where you become uncertain. That point is a better question for a mentor than asking for another complete tour of the entire project.

**Checkpoint question:** How would you teach this distinction using only the experiment “Explain why a timestamp is unnecessary for this contract.”? Leave your answer in the session journal before reading the mentor hints.

## Clinic 2: Exclusive cutoff

A boundary that does not include equality.

**Small experiment:** Mark the fixture found exactly on the cutoff as excluded.

Find the part of `findBefore and isDateOnly` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

## Clinic 3: Shallow copy

A new top-level object whose nested references would still be shared.

**Small experiment:** State the current flat-shape assumption explicitly.

Find the part of `findBefore and isDateOnly` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

## Clinic 4: Source order

The order supplied by the caller.

**Small experiment:** Compare filtering with sorting as separate operations.

Find the part of `findBefore and isDateOnly` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

## Read a real source window

The following is an excerpt from [public/core.js](../public/core.js), beginning at source line 1. It is a reading window, not a standalone runnable exercise. Open the linked file for surrounding declarations and context.

```js
export function isDateOnly(value) {
  if (typeof value !== 'string' || !/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/.test(value)) return false;
  const [year, month, day] = value.split('-').map(Number);
  if (year < 1 || month < 1 || month > 12 || day < 1) return false;
  const leap = year % 4 === 0 && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0);
  const days = [31, leap ? 29 : 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];
  return day <= days[month - 1];
}
export function findBefore(items, cutoff) {
  if (!Array.isArray(items)) throw new TypeError('Items must be an array.');
  if (!isDateOnly(cutoff)) throw new RangeError('Cutoff must be a real YYYY-MM-DD date.');
  const result = [];
  const ids = new Set();
  for (const item of items) {
    if (!item || typeof item.id !== 'string' || !item.id.trim() || ids.has(item.id) ||
        typeof item.label !== 'string' || !item.label.trim() || !isDateOnly(item.foundOn)) {
      throw new TypeError('Each item needs a unique ID, label and real foundOn date.');
    }
    ids.add(item.id);
    // Fixed-width valid dates sort chronologically. The cutoff is strictly before.
    if (item.foundOn < cutoff) result.push({ ...item });
  }
  return result;
}
```

For each meaningful line, label its job as input interpretation, validation, state ownership, transformation, output or presentation. Some files contain only a subset of those jobs. Do not force the categories onto code that does not perform them. A closing brace is structure, not a separate business rule.

Choose one expression and restate it as a question the program answers. Then choose one expression that merely carries out a consequence of that answer. This separates a product decision from mechanical plumbing. If you cannot explain an operator, isolate a tiny example rather than rewriting the whole function.

## A three-column scratch sheet

| Before | Rule or operation | After |
|---|---|---|
| Write an actual supported input or layout situation | Name the owning function, property or event | Predict the concrete result |
| Change one assumption | State which rule now matters | Predict what changes and what remains stable |
| Use an invalid, missing or unsupported case | Identify the boundary that rejects or handles it | Predict feedback and retained state |

Do not fill the After column by running the reference first. That turns prediction practice into transcription. After predicting, observe the program and put discrepancies in a fourth note below the table. A wrong prediction is useful when you can name the mistaken assumption.

## What understanding looks like

You can locate `findBefore and isDateOnly`, explain why the adapter has a separate job, and produce a new counterexample without borrowing one from the tests. You can also say what the reference deliberately does not support. If one of those is missing, choose the smallest clinic above that addresses it and repeat that clinic with different data.
