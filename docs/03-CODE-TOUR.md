# Code tour and architecture decisions

[Overview](../README.md) · [Concepts](02-CONCEPTS-AND-TRACES.md)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [package.json](../package.json) | Names the module format, Node requirement and local commands; private prevents npm publication. |
| [.github/workflows/check.yml](../.github/workflows/check.yml) | Runs the committed checks on GitHub. A workflow file is not evidence that a remote run succeeded. |
| [public/index.html](../public/index.html) | Semantic content, controls and explicit IDs. |
| [public/style.css](../public/style.css) | Presentation, focus indication and project-specific layout. |
| [tools/serve.mjs](../tools/serve.mjs) | Local preview infrastructure; only public/ is served. |
| [tools/check-site.mjs](../tools/check-site.mjs) | Checks referenced local assets exist, without pretending to judge usability. |
| [public/core.js](../public/core.js) | The main input/output rule; no DOM access. |
| [public/app.js](../public/app.js) | Browser events, parsing, rendering and visible errors. |
| [test/core.test.js](../test/core.test.js) | Independent boundary examples for the core contract. |
| [public/fixtures.js](../public/fixtures.js) | Small fictional inputs designed to expose important distinctions. |

## Follow one path, not every file

Start at [public/core.js](../public/core.js) and locate `findBefore and isDateOnly`. Use this trace as a map: Cutoff 2026-10-03 is validated → loop checks LP-01 through LP-05 → 01 and 02 are strictly earlier → 03 is equal and excluded → new shallow objects for the first two items enter a new result array.

The tooling is intentionally separate from the product concept. You can study the local server or CI after the main rule is clear. Neither an HTTP preview server nor a workflow configuration should become a prerequisite for understanding an inline-block box or a small pure function.

## Decision: Use a date-only domain

These records describe calendar days, not instants. Parsing them into local timestamps could introduce a timezone concern that the user never supplied. Valid fixed-width date strings can be compared chronologically.

**Review question:** Explain why the shape and actual calendar validity must be checked before string comparison.

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Keep the cutoff strictly before

An item on the cutoff day does not match. This is a deliberate product decision and has its own equality test. An inclusive mode would be a separate feature, not an unnoticed operator change.

**Review question:** State the expected result before deciding between < and <=.

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Build a new result with a manual loop

A fresh array and shallow copies protect the flat fixture records from accidental top-level edits through the result. This is not a deep-clone guarantee for arbitrary nested objects.

**Review question:** Explain which mutation would still be shared if you later add a nested metadata object.

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Change boundaries

A small change should begin in the file that owns its meaning. Change domain rules in the core, wording and interaction in the browser adapter, and layout in the relevant CSS rule. For the static references, semantic information belongs in HTML before styling. For the Git reference, the staged snapshot boundary belongs in the helper rather than being guessed from editor state.

If a story crosses two files, say why. A new unit, weather option or UI station may require a contract, a control and tests to change together. That is a coherent feature boundary, not permission to rewrite unrelated parts of the project.

## Deliberate limits

No persistence, external integration or general framework is hidden behind these files. The preview server is a local development aid, not a production hosting system. A browser screenshot is one observation, not proof of every device or assistive technology. Keep these limits visible when describing your own work.
